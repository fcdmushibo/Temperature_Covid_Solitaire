# temperature_Covid_Solitaire
This was the raw code for solitaire in daily temperature check-in group chat which required by school in 2020.
the solitaire was requiring every student in the class to put their name and daily temperature in the group chat.
it was the formalism paperwork for students and literary everyone just type in a normal temperature without measuring themselves.
this code help students from doing this everyday.
there was 23 student in my class and name was been blur.
